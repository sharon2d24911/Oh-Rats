Why...
Why... How could you do this?!
What did we do to deserve this?!
You're a perfection-obsessed megalomaniac...
Crushing us underfoot like ants...
Try putting yourself in our shoes!
Can't you see the horrible <color=#c44f4f>ratmosphere</color> you created?!
You <color=#c44f4f>knead</color> to recognize your mistakes!
How can your heart be so cold...
What happened to a shop that feels like magic?!
All we wanted was to even the score...
Now we're just a <color=#c44f4f>whisker</color> away from oblivion...
It's all your doing.
Haha... you must be ecstatic...
Is this what you wanted?
To be all alone?
Well, congrats.
One day, your bakery will grieve this loss of justice...
One day, you will see...
You can't escape the <color=#c44f4f>whisks</color> of fate...

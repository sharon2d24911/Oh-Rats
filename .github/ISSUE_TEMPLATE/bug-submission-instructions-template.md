Before making a new issue, check out our current list (we have the filters to narrow them down if there are too many... because there will probably be a lot of issues... yay organization!) to make sure it won't be a duplicate üîç

**Location:** Which scene of the game is the bug found on? (e.g., Tutorial, Game - Swarm 3 Wave 2, Lose screen, etc.)

**Description:** What is the bug? How does it affect the game?

**Replication:** How can everyone else replicate this bug? If unsure, please give any context about where you encountered the bug

**Branch/Version:** If you were testing directly from Unity, which programmer's branch were you testing from and, if you know, [which commit was it](https://github.com/Philosophical-Zombies/OhRats/commits/main)? You could test from the main branch but we haven't been the best at updating it so um... I wouldn't... üßç In most cases testing the branch that has the most recent push should be fine! If you were testing from an itch.io build, when did you test it and which itch.io link did you test from? A general idea of when you tested the branch or itch.io link is fine, we'll just need to know approximately which version of the game it was

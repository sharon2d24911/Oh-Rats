## Notes:
1. Make sure to be working on a WebGL build!
2. Take extra care when pulling any code that requires merging of Scenes, maybe make copies of your current Scenes before pulling if you've made important changes you think might be affected
3. Please push the Unity project to your branches without adding it to a separate folder (i.e., the folder itself is OhRats, so there's no need to upload with another folder wrapping the project as it will make the code harder to merge when pulling)
4. Describe in the commit message what has been changed — short descriptions are fine but generally we shouldn't have single word commit messages (some [general guidelines compiled by other Github users](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53))
5. Check over the issues tab and create issues for bugs or other items for discussion
6. [Folder for programmers in shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hjYj-Z5KZSilB_Ix2iS3OlUAy7iyA7jz?usp=drive_link), linked in case there's anything we want to upload outside of code

# OhRats
Current milestone: Vertical slice (October 27, 2023)
## Notes:
1. Make sure to be working on a WebGL build!
2. Please push the Unity project to your branches without adding it to a separate folder (i.e., the folder itself is OhRats, so there's no need to upload with another folder wrapping the project as it will make the code harder to merge when pulling)
3. Describe in the commit message what has been changed â€” short descriptions are fine but generally we shouldn't have single word commit messages (some [general guidelines compiled by other Github users](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53))
4. PRs can be discussed as we go and there's no particular "perfect time" to make one, but generally we'll want to make them once the code has been tested by someone other than the programmer who coded it so we can solve merge issues earlier on and have a good idea by looking at our main branch of what progress is like
5. [Folder for programmers in shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hjYj-Z5KZSilB_Ix2iS3OlUAy7iyA7jz?usp=drive_link), linked in case there's anything we want to upload outside of code
